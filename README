Introduction
------------
CouchKit is a toolkit for working with CouchDB in multiple languages.
Currently it supports Java and Ruby, with native Java bindings to CouchDB
documents.

Building CouchKit
-----------------
To build the Java bindings, first edit the file:
src/test/resources/test.properties
and change couchdb.server to point to your CouchDB instance. Then build everything:
mvn clean install
The Ruby bindings are ready to use in src/main/ruby

Usage
-----
To see how to use CouchKit, have a look at the tests:
src/test/java
src/test/ruby
